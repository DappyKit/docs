# Contracts

The DappyKit set of smart contracts allows storing changes in a person's account through self-control or by delegating control to an external gateway. A distinctive feature of these contracts is the ability to return control to the person over any data of their account at any point of change. The set consists of 3 contracts:
- SocialConnections.sol: Designed to store references to data about people's social connections.
- FilesystemChanges.sol: Intended for storing references to data about changes in people's file systems.
- UserVerification.sol: Used to issue a verification token to the user, confirming their registration in an external system.
